# credit_card_sanitizer

Users sometimes enter sensitive information such as credit card numbers into Web sites where they shouldn't.
If a credit card number is entered into a form on a Web site, it may get stored in a database and logged
to log files. This is probably undesirable for the business running the Web site. Once the credit card
number is stored in multiple places on your systems, it can be hard to get rid of it.

Removal of credit card information is an important element in compliance with the [Payment Card Industry
Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org).

`credit_card_sanitizer` scans text for credit card numbers by applying the Luhn checksum algorithm,
implemented by the [luhn_checksum](https://github.com/zendesk/luhn_checksum) gem, and by validating that the
number matches a known credit card number pattern. Numbers in text that appear to be valid credit card numbers
are "sanitized" by replacing some or all of the digits with a replacement character. In the PCI DSS, this
process is referred to as _truncation_, and the result is referred to as a
[truncated Primary Account Number (PAN)](https://pcissc.secure.force.com/faq/articles/Frequently_Asked_Question/Are-truncated-Primary-Account-Numbers-PAN-required-to-be-protected-in-accordance-with-PCI-DSS).

### Basic Usage

The main entry point is `CreditCardSanitizer#sanitize!`. This will perform sanitization of a string in-place,
much like `String#gsub!` does for substring replacement.

```ruby
text = "Hello my card is 4111 1111 1111 1111  maybe you should not store that in your database!"
CreditCardSanitizer.new(replacement_character: '▇').sanitize!(text)
text == "Hello my card is 4111 11▇▇ ▇▇▇▇ 1111 maybe you should not store that in your database!"
```

The return value of `sanitize!` is similar to `String#gsub!`: If no changes are made to the input string,
`nil` is returned. If any changes were made, the string is modified in-place, but the resulting string
is also returned.

### Configuration

| Name                       | Description                                                                                  |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `replacement_token`        | The character used to replace digits of the credit number.  The default is `▇`.              |
| `expose_first`             | The number of leading digits of the credit card number to leave intact. The default is `6`.  |
| `expose_last`              | The number of trailing digits of the credit card number to leave intact. The default is `4`. |
| `use_groupings`            | Use known card number groupings to reduce false positives. The default is `false`.           |
| `exclude_tracking_numbers` | Identify shipping tracking numbers and don't truncate them. The default is `false`.          |
| `return_changes`           | When `true`, `sanitize!` returns a list of redactions made. The default is `false`.          |

### Default Replacement Level

The default configuration of `credit_card_sanitizer` leaves the first 6 and last 4 digits of credit card
numbers intact, and replaces all the digits in between with `replacement_token`.

This level of truncation is [sufficient for PCI compliance](https://pcissc.secure.force.com/faq/articles/Frequently_Asked_Question/What-are-acceptable-formats-for-truncation-of-primary-account-numbers).

### Line noise

`credit_card_sanitizer` allows for "line noise" between the digits of a credit card number.  Line noise
is a sequence of non-numeric characters. For example, all of the following numbers will be truncated
successfully:

```
4111 1111 1111 1111
4111-1111-1111-1111
4111*1111***1111*****1111
```

We occasionally tweak the regular expression that defines line noise to reduce the rate of false positives.

### Card number length and valid prefixes

Numbers are truncated if they are a minimum of 12 digits long and a maximum of 19 digits long, and have a proper
prefix that matches an IIN range of an issuing network like Visa or MasterCard
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_Account_Number). We have borrowed the regex used in [active_merchant](https://github.com/Shopify/active_merchant/blob/master/lib/active_merchant/billing/credit_card_methods.rb#L5-L18)
to validate these prefixes.

### Card number groupings

Some false positives are inevitable when using this gem, and they can be a nuisance.

To reduce the false positive rate, you can specify `use_groupings: true` when configuring the sanitizer. This causes
the sanitizer to pay attention to the groupings of numbers as it scans them, only truncating numbers that

- have a valid Luhn checksum
- match a pattern for a known credit card type
- are either a single contiguous string of digits, or digits in groups matching that known credit card type

Example: Visa cards are 4 groups of 4 digits, `XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX`. `4111 1111 1111 1111` is a number that matches
the Visa pattern (starts with `4`) and passes Luhn checksum.

With `use_groupings: true`, the sanitizer would truncate `4111111111111111` and `4111 1111 1111 1111` but not
`41 11 11 11 11 11 11 11` or `41111111 11111111`.

With `use_groupings: false`, the sanitizer would perform the truncation on all of the above strings.

### Exclude Tracking Numbers

Occasionally, a number will match a known credit card pattern and pass Luhn checksum, but will actually
be a shipping company tracking number, such as a FedEx tracking number.

The `exclude_tracking_numbers` option runs candidate numbers about to be truncated through the
[tracking_number gem](https://github.com/jkeen/tracking_number) by Jeff Keen.

Turning on this option reduces the likelihood of a tracking number being identified as a false positive
and truncated. However, it runs the risk of an actual credit card number being incorrectly identified as
a shipping tracking number, and not truncated.

### Exclusion of URLs and phone numbers

Phone numbers and numeric IDs in URLs sometimes resemble credit card numbers and pass Luhn checksum.
The gem tries to avoid sanitizing these by scanning for these types of strings in text:

- Leading `+`, which often precedes the country code in a phone number
- Leading `/`, which precedes a relative URL
- The protocol and `://` in an absolute URL, such as `https://`

The gem works by scanning through blocks of text using a regular expression that matches numeric
sequences. The regular expression also matches the above-mentioned patterns. The idea is that the captured
text will include the prefix, instead of just being the numeric sequence itself. If the prefix is present
in the captured text, the numeric sequence won't be sanitized. Numeric sequences are only sanitized
if they're captured on their own.

### `return_changes` option

As mentioned above, the return value of `sanitize!` is similar to `String#gsub!`: The modified string
is returned, if changes were made; otherwise, `nil` is returned.

The `return_changes` option alters the behavior of `sanitize!` to return an array of the individual credit
card numbers that were found, and the redacted versions they were replaced with:

```ruby
irb(main):004:0> sanitizer=CreditCardSanitizer.new(return_changes:true)
=> #<CreditCardSanitizer:0x000000013791f108 @settings={:replacement_token=>...
irb(main):005:0> sanitizer.sanitize!('Hello 4111 1111 1111 1111 there and hello
3782 822463 10005 there')
=> [["4111 1111 1111 1111", "4111 11▇▇ ▇▇▇▇ 1111"], ["3782 822463 10005", "3782 82▇▇▇▇ ▇0005"]]
irb(main):006:0>
```

Note that `sanitize!` still returns `nil` if nothing was changed, even with the `return_changes` option.

```ruby
irb(main):006:0> sanitizer.sanitize!('foo bar')
=> nil
```

### Rails filtering parameters

The `#parameter_filter` is meant to be used with `ActionDispatch` to automatically truncate PANs
found in Rails parameters that are to be logged, before the logs are flushed to disk.

```ruby
Rails.app.config.filter_parameters = [:password, CreditCardSanitizer.parameter_filter]

env = {
  "action_dispatch.request.parameters" => {"credit_card_number" => "4111 1111 1111 1111", "password" => "123"},
  "action_dispatch.parameter_filter" => Rails.app.config.filter_parameters
}

>> ActionDispatch::Request.new(env).filtered_parameters
=> {"credit_card_number" => "4111 11▇▇ ▇▇▇▇ 1111", "password" => "[FILTERED]"}
```

### Releasing a new version
A new version is published to RubyGems.org every time a change to `version.rb` is pushed to the `main` branch.
In short, follow these steps:
1. Update `version.rb`,
2. run `bundle lock` to update `Gemfile.lock`,
3. merge this change into `main`, and
4. look at [the action](https://github.com/zendesk/credit_card_sanitizer/actions/workflows/publish.yml) for output.

To create a pre-release from a non-main branch:
1. change the version in `version.rb` to something like `1.2.0.pre.1` or `2.0.0.beta.2`,
2. push this change to your branch,
3. go to [Actions → “Publish to RubyGems.org” on GitHub](https://github.com/zendesk/credit_card_sanitizer/actions/workflows/publish.yml),
4. click the “Run workflow” button,
5. pick your branch from a dropdown.
